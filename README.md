# AI Credit Scoring Model
## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive simulator for an AI-powered credit scoring model. It allows users to input various financial profile parameters and instantly receive a creditworthiness assessment, complete with a score, a descriptive category (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good), and a detailed justification based on the provided inputs. Additionally, the simulator provides insights into the performance metrics of the underlying AI model (a Simulated Random Forest classifier) used for the prediction.

## Features

*   **Financial Profile Input:** Easily enter key financial data such as annual income, total debt, credit utilization, late payments, age of oldest account, and total number of open accounts.
*   **Creditworthiness Assessment:** Get an immediate credit score and a qualitative assessment (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent) generated by the AI model.
*   **Justification:** Understand the key factors influencing the credit score with a clear, concise explanation.
*   **Simulated Model Performance:** Review essential machine learning evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC) to gauge the simulated accuracy of the underlying AI model.
*   **Interactive UI:** A clean and intuitive user interface designed for ease of use.

## How it Works

The core of this project is a simulated AI classification model (specifically, a Random Forest) that has been trained to predict creditworthiness based on common financial indicators. When you input your financial data and click "Assess Creditworthiness," the model processes these inputs to:

1.  **Calculate a Credit Score:** A numerical score is generated, reflecting the likelihood of credit default.
2.  **Categorize Creditworthiness:** The numerical score is mapped to a descriptive category (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good).
3.  **Provide Justification:** Key input parameters are highlighted to explain the reasoning behind the assessment.

The "Simulated Model Performance" section showcases typical evaluation metrics you would see when assessing the real-world performance of a trained machine learning model, indicating its reliability and accuracy on unseen data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [List any prerequisites here, e.g., Node.js, Python, specific libraries if this is a web app or script.]

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-credit-scoring-model.git
    cd ai-credit-scoring-model
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Example for a web project
    npm install
    # or
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    # Example for a web project
    npm start
    # or
    python app.py
    ```

### Usage

1.  Open the application in your web browser (usually `http://localhost:3000` or similar).
2.  Fill in the "Financial Profile Input" fields with the desired values.
3.  Click the "Assess Creditworthiness" button.
4.  View the "Creditworthiness Assessment" and "Simulated Model Performance" results.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** [Specify technologies like React, Vue, Angular, HTML/CSS/JavaScript]
*   **Backend:** [Specify technologies like Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), Ruby on Rails]
*   **AI/ML:** [Specify if you used a specific library like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch for the *simulated* model, or just conceptual]
*   **Styling:** [e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap]

## Future Enhancements

*   Allow users to compare multiple profiles.
*   Add a visual graph of credit score trends over time (if historical data is part of the simulation).
*   Implement different AI model types for comparison (e.g., Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest).
*   Expand the dataset used for training the *simulated* model for more nuanced predictions.
*   Integrate a more detailed explanation of each model performance metric.
